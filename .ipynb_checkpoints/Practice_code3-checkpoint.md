**Q3:** Write a program get a number from user and print if it is prime or composite.

---

**Q4:** Write a program to get a number from the user and print its factorial as output.

---

**Q5:** Write a program to get the value of ***n*** from the user and print the first ***n*** terms of the Fibonacci series as output.

---

**Q6:** Write a program to get a number ***n*** from the user and print its reverse as output.

---

**Q7:** Write a program to get a number and check if it is an armstrong number or not.  

**Condition:** Armstrong / Narcissistic number is the number in any given number base, which forms the total of the same number, when each of its digits is raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.
>**Sample 1:**  
I/P:
153  
O/P:
Armstrong Number  

**Explanation:** $ 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 $

<br>
>**Sample 2:**  
I/P:  
407  
O/P:  
Armstrong Number  
**Explanation:** $ 4^3 + 0^3 + 7^3 = 407 $

<br>
>**Sample 3:**  
I/P:  
107
O/P:  
Not an Armstrong Number
