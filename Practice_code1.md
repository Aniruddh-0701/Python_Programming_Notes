**Q8:** Write a program to get the side of the square and print its perimeter  
Perimeter of a square = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math= $\rm{4 \times side}$ ">
**Q9:** Write a program to get the side of the square and print its area  
Area of square = $\rm{side \times side}$

**Q10:** Write a program to get the length and breadth of a rectangle and print its perimeter  
Perimeter of a rectangle = $\rm{2 \times (length + breadth)}$

**Q11:** Write a program to get the length and breadth of a rectangle and print its area  
Area of a rectangle = $\rm{length \times breadth}$

**Q12:** Write a program to get the number of sides and length of each side of a regular polygon and print its perimeter.  
Perimeter = $\rm{number~of~ sides \times length~ of~ one~ side}$

**Q13:** Write a program to get the length and height of a right triangle and print its area.  
Area of right triangle = $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \rm{side^2}$

**Q14:** Write a program to get the radius of a circle and print its perimeter. (Take $\pi = 3.14159$)  
Perimeter of a circle = $2\pi \times \rm{radius}$

**Q15:** Write a program to get the radius of a circle and print its area. (Take $\pi = 3.14159$)  
Area of a circle = $\pi \times \rm{radius^2}$

**Q16:** Write a program to get the sides of a triangle and print its area using Heron's Formula.  
Area of right triangle = $\sqrt{s \times (s-a)\times(s-b)\times(s-c)}$  
where,  
$s$ = Semi-Perimeter = $\dfrac{\rm{Perimter ~of ~triangle}}{2}$  
$a, b, c$ = Sides of the triangle
